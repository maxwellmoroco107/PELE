# PELE: Polarization and Energetics in Line Emission Control Board

PELE control board MCU firmware
PELE is designed to provide a microprocessor for variable control over an array of birefringent filters onboard a BCT XB1 CubeSat using the power distribution network of the platform. Since this system operates in a LEO environment, of which intense radiation and extreme temperature fluctuations are characteristic, the system has high signal integrity attributes and contingencies that allow it to operate in such harsh environments. PELE is designed to operate with low power consumption in its active state and ultra-low power consumption in its dormant state to prevent unnecessary energy consumption. Through the use of a microprocessor, a custom PCB provides adjustable variable amplitude square wave signals that can adjust the operation of each of the LCVRs via configuration from the user. Seven signals will regularly be generated, four of which are wavelength tuning crystal signals, two of which are polarimetric modulation signals for incoming light, and one of which triggers the camera. The optical array itself is designed to collect data on a wide range of solar radiation, requiring frequent adjustment of the six ferro-electric LCVRs that comprise the array.	Figure 1 shows the top level diagram of PELE.
